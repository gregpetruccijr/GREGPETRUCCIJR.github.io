**Welcome!**
- _My name is Greg Petrucci, and I am a researcher passionate about innovating human health with wearable technology_. I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Massachusetts in the [Department of Kinesiology](https://www.umass.edu/sphhs/kinesiology) working under the supervision of [John R. Sirard, Ph.D.](https://blogs.umass.edu/pahl/about-us/bios/john-sirard/). I also work closely with [John Staudenmayer](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/directory/faculty/john-staudenmayer). My research interests lie in using accelerometers to estimate aspects of physical behaviors (e.g., physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep).

**Research**
 - I work on projects related to calibration and validation of accelerometer data processing methods (see [MOCA](https://gregpetrucci.com/moca/) for more details).


**Publications, Conference Abstracts, and PresentationsðŸ“š**
- [ðŸ“š](pubs.md) (publications page) lists  refereed publications, conference abstracts, presentations, and more. Including a _.pdf_ of my (somewhat up-to-date?) [CV](https://gregpetrucci.com/assets/js/viewerjs-0.5.8/ViewerJS/PetrucciJr_CV_03_28_24.pdf).

**Teaching**
- Teaching is equally important and exciting to me as working in the lab. Connecting with undergraduate students is so much fun.  [My CV](PetrucciJr_CV_03_28_24.pdf) lists all my teaching experiences (e.g., laboratory teaching assistantships and instructor of record).
- Be on the lookout for a [blog post](https://gregpetrucci.com/2024-04-07-fall-24-courses/) announcing my Summer 2024, Fall 2024, and Spring 2025 teaching schedule.

**Get in Touch**
- Head over to the [blog page](https://gregpetrucci.com/blog/) to see what I've been up to.
