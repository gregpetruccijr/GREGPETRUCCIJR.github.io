**Why Sponsor Me?**
 - Sponsorship is an investment in _open-source science_. 
 - My goal is to make accelerometer data processing methods (i.e., existing and new, simple cut-points and complex machine learning techniques) **_easily accessible for scientists conducting intervention and cohort studies_**. 
 - Your sponsorship will allow me to dedicate my time to this open-source, user-friendly project.  
 - Additionally, your sponsorship will contribute to hosting, domain names, and other expenses required to maintain and develop this open-source goal. 
 - In return, I am committed to providing high-quality, well-documented code, timely issue resolution, and regular updates to my sponsors. Let's work together to make the open-source community more robust and sustainable.
 
**Other Reasons For Sponsorship**
 - I also offer assistance with processing previously collected accelerometer data, for which there are no easily accessible methods (i.e., the method has been developed, and reproducible instructions exist in text) that can be applied to estimate aspects of physical behavior. See the [Accelerometer Repository](https://sites.google.com/view/accelerometerrepository/available-models/provided-in-paper?authuser=0) for an example of methods that apply. 
- Please email me for more details on this type of support at gp@gregpetrucci.com.

**What Makes Me Qualified For This Work?**

**Research**
 - I've worked extensively on projects aimed at calibration and validation of accelerometer data processing methods (see [MOCA](https://gregpetrucci.com/moca/) for more details).

**Publications, Conference Abstracts, and Presentations**
- My refereed publications (links included), conference abstracts, presentations, and more can be viewed on [my website](https://gregpetrucci.com/pubs/).
- At the bottom of that page, you can download and view a _.pdf of my CV_.

**Get in Touch**
- I am always interested in new collaborations, expanding my research network, and general chatter. Please feel free to email me at gp@gregpetrucci.com for more details on anything mentioned above.

## Sign Up Links 
I use all of the brands/products listed in my workflow. Depending on the brand/product, when you sign up for a subscription or purchase a product with my personalized links below, I receive either a discounted subscription rate, coupons for future purchases, or a small percentage of my initial purchase back in cash (e.g., 5%). Beyond the financial benefit I stand to gain from listing these brands/products here, person to person-- my work has benefitted from using them, and I highly recommend them to others with similar needs. I've tried to include a brief description of each to help others assess if these products are right for their work too.  

1. [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/referrals/redeem?key=3zico4dz0ur4601x)

4. [Secretlab](https://secretlabus.refr.cc/gregpetrucci)
  - When you spend  hours a day seated in the same position, no matter how optimal, stress builds up in your body. Movement is crucial to relieving this strain. TITAN Evo is designed to promote natural posture changes and movement.
