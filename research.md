**Research**

I work on projects related to calibration and validation of accelerometer data processing methods (see [MOCA](https://gregpetrucci.com/moca/) for more details on a related project we are finishing soon).

The [publications page](https://gregpetrucci.com/pubs/) lists my refereed publications, conference abstracts, presentations, and other research deliverables I have worked on. Including, a _.pdf_ of my (somewhat up-to-date?) [CV](https://gregpetrucci.com/assets/pdfs/PetrucciJr_CV_03_28_24.pdf).

_Recently I've been keen on making accelerometer data processing methods (i.e., existing and new, simple cut-points and complex machine learning techniques) easily accessible for use in intervention and cohort studies._ I plan to build on the work of [Clevenger et al.,][1] and [Pffeiffer et al.,][2] where my specific goals are to 1) ecologically identify and 2) provide (end)user-friendly access to accelerometer data processing methods that are accurate, reliable, and sensitive to detect changes in physical behaviors that are known to be associated with human health.
